## ðŸ§  About Me

I am a PhD student at IIT Madras currently working on Reinforcement Learning under the guidance of [Dr. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravindran/).This blog serves as a curated collection of my notes, tutorials, and some random ideas/inspirations. I keep this blog updated, so feel free to point out mistakes or collaborate at any part of the iteration.
