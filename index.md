## ðŸ§  About Me

I'm a researcher interested in the intersection of reinforcement learning, planning, and logical reasoning. Currently working under the guidance of [Dr. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravindran/) at IIT Madras, I focus on developing intelligent agents capable of structured decision-making under uncertainty.

This blog serves as a curated collection of my notes, tutorials, and ideas.
